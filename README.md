# SPA for displaying GitHub repositories

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Stack:

* React
* Redux
* TypeScript
* Axios
* Redux-saga

## Description:

With this application you can get a list of the repositories of the company you are interested in. You just need to enter the name of the company in the input, click on the button or on Enter and the list is in front of you. In each card you will see the name of the repository, URL, number of forks, watchers, stargazers. Clicking on the title or link will take you to the GitHub repository itself.
